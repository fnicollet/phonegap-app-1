services also gather information about the hardware and software used, such as 
IP address, browser type, operating system, domain name and Web site addresses 
from which a user has logged in. This information is used to improve the quality 
of service and to provide general statistics about MELCOME. MELCOME 
services also collect information on the pages visited by users within the 
service. Data related to visited pages are never linked to your personal 
information. Personal information is collected solely in order to access 
value-added services.
